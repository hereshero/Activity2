<h1> When She Dissapeared </h1>
<h3>By Dr Taylor Alison Swift</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="div2">
    <p>When she fell, she fell apart.<br>
    Cracked Her Bones on the pavement once she decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk<br>
    When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away<br>
    With the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends.</p>

    <p>When She looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
    forming the words of a thousand voices  <br>
    Echoes she heard even in her sleep:<br>
    "Whatever you say, it is not right."
    "Whatever you do, it is not enough." <br>
    "Your kindness is fake."<br>
    "Your pain is Manipulative"

</p>

    <p>When she lay there on the ground,,<br>
    She dreamed of time machines and revenge<br>
    and a love that was really something,<br>
    When in eternal lines to time thou growâ€™st:<br>
     Not just the idea of something.<br>
     </p>
    </div>
